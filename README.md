## Wireframes

The wireframes for The Game of Thrones Quiz were produced in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). There are frames for a full width display and a small mobile device. The final site varies a little due to some changes being made during development.

## Site Structure

When entering the site, users will be on the [home page](index.html) which is the Landing page. There is a 'Lets Play' button which users can click to enter the [game page](game.html). Once on the game page, users will be faced with the first question from the quiz. Everytime they click on an answer, the next question will load. Once 10 questions have been answered, they will be redirected to the [end page](end.html). On the end page, they will see their total score and have the option to either play again which will reload the quiz, or, they can go home which will redirect them to the home page.

## Design Choices

* ### Typography
    * The font chosen was 'Cinzel'. I chose this font because it was the closest font to the original Game of Thrones font. Cinzel falls back to to serif.
    Cinzel is an easy on the eye type of font and is easy to read.

* ### Color Scheme
     The color scheme was chosen based on the colors from one of the original Game of Thrones logos. The colors were black and white, but decided to use the color snow instead of white with reference to 'Jon Snow' who was a main character on the show. I added details of Burgundy because I thought it would complement the main colors of Black and White. The reason burgundy was chosen was because after some research online, I found that burgundy was the most used shade of color throught the show.

# Features

The Game of Thrones quiz was made to be simple and easy to play. The thought behind this was that users should not be overwhelmed with complicated instructions or navigation. It should be a simple fun quiz which does not require any effort to play it.

* ### Home

    * This is the landing page, where potential visitors will come to once they have entered the site. I have chosen an image with 'The Iron Throne' which is what the original Game of Thrones series is about.
    * Users will the see the page title (The Game of Thrones Quiz) at the top which is self-explanatory.
    * Under the image, there is a 'Lets Play' button which will take them to the main game.

    * At the top of the page, the game title is still visible.
    * Just under the title, there is a heads up display (HUD) which will show the user information on how many questions they have answered out of 10, and also how many points they have been awarded.
    * Under the HUD, users will see the first question and 4 possible choices from which they can choose 1 from. A new question will load everytime they have chosen an answer.
